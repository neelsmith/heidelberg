## Conclusion

As our title indicates, these are preliminary results, but they are significant for Homerists.  We showed  that the scribe of the Venetus A planned the layout of the manuscript so that he could incorporate material from a variety of no longer extant sources, and that those sources, to differing degrees, sometimes preserve verbatim language of Aristarchus of Samothrace.  The topic modelling and machine learning methods we applied were made possible by the HMT architecture.



We expect them to be refined and modified as later scholars work with a complete edition of the Venetus A and its scholia.

## Editions aren't just for people


-   morphologically parsed edition
-   metrically analyzed *Iliads*
-   texts optimized for Topic Modelling

## General conclusions

-   digital editions *always* mediated by machine
-   syntax is not enough:  *model/specification/implementation*
-   editing, reading, analysis converge
