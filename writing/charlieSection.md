This paper will now conclude with a abbreviated discussion of two research questions concerning the history of the Iliadic scholia which we were able to pursue through our digital edition of the Venetus A. While a longer discussion is possible, the aim here is to highlight how the implementation of the semantic model in our digital editions makes the following analyses possible. The first analysis concerns the layout of scholia within a typical page of the Venetus A.

Shown above is the fisrt page of the Venetus A manuscript to contain text from the *Iliad*, with the various colored overlays lying on top of the differents zone of scholia on a typical page. For reference, the actual text of the *Iliad* lies in the middle of the page, with the letters written in a darker ink. There are five distinct zones of scholia on a manuscript page: main scholia (shown in yellow), intermarginal scholia (shown in red), interior scholia (shown in blue), exterior scholia (shown in green), and interlinear scholia (not highlighted with a color, but these scholia lie in-between the lines of the *Iliad* text). While not every folio of the Venetus A contains every type of scholia, every folio maintains the spatial integrity of the five zones. So even if there are no exterior scholia on a particular folio, the scribe will not write anything in the space typically occupied by an exterior scholion.  

While the difference in placement on the page for these five distinct zones of Venetus A scholia is patently obvious to any casual onlooker, the difference in function among these zones is much less obvious. This relationship between a scholion's content and its position on the page form the foundation of this first analysis. For example, why would a scribe include a scholion in the main-scholia zone as opposed to the intermarginal zone? Some of this work in trying to disambiguate the function of the five zones had already been completed by the end of the nineteenth century. For example, Karl Dindorf, in his 1875 preface to his edition of the Venetus A scholia, argues that the interlinear zone presents no more than glosses on the words which lie below them (ix), and indeed this does seem to be their primary function. As for the exterior scholia, T. W. Allen, in an 1899 article titled "On the Composition of Some Greeks Mansucripts," put forth his hypothesis that these scholia are the result of an editorial pass through the manuscript (181). For Allen, the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia were all written by the same scribe, but the exterior scholia were undoubtedly the work of a different scribe checking the work of the previous scribe against the original sources for the manuscript and making corrections when necessary in the outer margin (172).

This analysis, however, will mostly focus on the much less clear relationship among the other three zones of scholia. For his part, Dindorf notes that many of the intermarginal and interior scholia are the same or nearly the same as main scholia and often use the same exact wording. To him, these shorter intermarginal and interior scholia appeared to be nothing more than redacted versions of the main scholia (Dindorf, vii). From his observations, Dindorf concluded that the intermarginal, interior, and main scholia must have come from similar, though still subtly different sources (vii). However, it is worth noting that when Dindorf uses the phrase *intermarginalia scholia* in his preface, he is actually referring to what the Homer Multitext project would consider the intermarginal and interior zones (Dindorf, vii). While Dindorf's description of the *intermarginalia scholia* is a bit obtuse, our interpretation of his words is strengthened by the fact that Dindorf in his edition marks all the scholia which he refers to as the *intermarginalia* with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing them with the main scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, however, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. T. W. Allen also seems to use the single term "intermarginal" to refer to the two distinct zones (181). Thus it is clear that for these two scholars the separation of scholia into interior and intermarginal scholia did not exist. For them, there was no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia.

This analysis therefore sought to elucidate some of the historical confusion concerning these three zones. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the various zones of scholia was quantitatively different. Specifically, we relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling. We were working with a corpus of 18 books of scholia from the Homer Multitext digital edition, which include roughly 8000 scholia. Because of the semantic model the digital editions of the scholia are built upon, it was relatively easy to create a version of the scholia which was optimized for topic modelling using scala. In general, running a topic model on an ancient Greek text requires a good deal of text wrangling. Not only do the scholia need to normalized in order to create a lemmatized version of the text, but topic modelling requires a corpus in which the most common words are eliminated from the corpus. Prior to conducting this specific analysis, we had already created various normalized versions of the Venetus A scholia by manipulating the archival text of the Homer Multitext project with the scala programming language. One such version of the text normalized the Homer Multitext's diplomatic transcription of the Venetus A according to its paleography (a p-normalized version), wherein the words of the scholia were normalized to match the explicit intention of the scribe. So words that were abbreviated were normalized to their expanded form. A second version of the text took the p-normalized version and normalized it further according to modern orthographic standards (o-normalized version). A third version took the o-normalized version and normalized it according to morphology in order to create a completely lemmatized version of the text (m-normalized version). This third version made use of the Morpheus parser. In light of this progression in normalization and since topic modelling requires a text which is heavily prepared, the topic modelling version of the scholia was created by removing the most common words from the the m-normalized version of the text. All of these various versions were able to manipulated so easily because the original archival HMT data was built upon that previously discussed explicit semantic model.

In order to analyze this version of the text optimized for topic modeling, we used ToPan, a topic modelling software developed by Thomas KoÃ«ntges. Because all topic modelling software require users to define the number of topics the program should produce, we had to experiment with a number of different topic numbers before moving forward. Having too many topics risks not observing any meaningful patterns since extant patterns may be arbitrarily split up into more topics than necessary. On the opposite side of thing, too few topics would render topcis meaningless since words that are supposed to belong to different topics are lumped together. Ultiamtely, we found that 15 topics worked best for our analysis. Finally, one of the advantages of ToPan is that it produces a clear visualization of the topic modelling results, such as the visualization seen below:

![15-topic model via ToPan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/heidelberg/master/imgs/TranslatedToPan9.jpg)

In this visualization, each of the circles on the left represents a different topic, and when a topic is highlighted, the words which are most strongly associated with the topic are listed on the right. For clarity, I have added Eglish translation of each of the most strongly associated words. Though the results of topic model actually exist in a multidimensional space, the results in this visualization are reduced into a two-dimensional plane using principal compontents analysis. The distance between circles is indicative of how related the topics are. 

As for this particular topic, what is most striking among the words which the computer found most strongly associated with one another is the repeated presence of the name Aristarchus. Aristarchus, along with Zenodotus and Aristophanes of Byzantium whose names also appear within this topic's most strongly associated words, were the three heads of the library of Alexandria in the third and second centuries B.C.E. All three men were prominent Homeric scholars producing seminal scholarship, traces of which and references to which exist in few sources but abound in the Venetus A scholia. Since a topic is more strictly defined as a repeated pattern of co-occurring words, the appearance of these three names within the same topic indicates that there is a specific pattern of language used when talking about these three scholars, and particular when discussing Aristarchus.

For the purposes of this analysis, it would be interesting and telling this pattern of language were to appear with a greater frequency in any of the three zones of interest (main, intermarginal, and interior). And while the ToPan visualization is a great tool for analyzing different word patterns, the visualization does not give information about what scholia are strongly or weakly associated with each of the topics. Outside of the visualization, ToPan does provide robust data tables providing this exact information. In other words, using these tables we were able to analyze how strongly the Aristarchus topic (Topic 9) is associated with each scholion since this relationship is scored quantitavtively by the software. This quantitaive measure is called the theta-score and exists on a scale of 0 to 1. Were a scholion to have a theta-score of 0.0 with respect to a particular topic, this would indicate that this particular scholion contains no content from that particular topic. Conversely, a theta-score of 1.0 would indicate that the content of this scholion would likely come only from this topic. 

Ultimately, we were able to move beyond just analyzing individual scholia to analyzin whole zones of scholia. Using these theta-tables and then separating out scholia according to their placement in one of the zones (main, intermarginal, and interior) we identified the proportion of scholia within each zone which were strongly associated with this Aristarchus topic (topic 9). We defined a "strong association" as a scholion having a theta-score equal to or greater than 0.9. Below are the results of this analysis. In the second column is the percent composition of scholia zones across the 18 Venetus A books of this dataset (excluding the exterior and interlinear scholia). In the third column is the percent composition of scholia zones within scholia determined to be strongly associated with the Aristarchus topic (Topic 9).  


| Zone                            | Total distrib. in Ven. A | Distrib. within Topic 9 |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------|:------------------------|
| Main scholia (yellow)           | 3597 (45.3%)         | 45.0 (32.37%)           |
| **Intermarginal scholia (red)** | **1219 (15.4%)**     | **65.0 (46.76%)**       |
| Interior scholia (blue)         | 819 (10.3%)          | 28.0 (20.14%)           |

What is noticeable about the above table is that not only do the intermarginal scholia constitute so much greater a proportion of scholia within this topic than the main scholia, but also that their proportion is over two times that of their proportion throughout the manuscript. Clearly, the zone distribution for topic 9 goes against the typical zone distribution seen across the manuscript It appears that the the language of topic 9 is zone-specific. Specifically, this "Aristarchus" topic seems to have a disproportionate concentration within the intermarginal scholia.

This is a point which requires a more thorough explanation in order to fully understand its import. The disproportionate concentration of topic 9 within intermarginal scholia does not mean that the intermarginal scholia are the only scholia where there is any writing about Aristarchus. First of all, it should be remembered that a "topic" is defined as words which co-occur frequently. Thus saying that a certain topic appears more in one zone over another only is saying that the particular pattern of co-occurring words identified by the topic model seems to occur more in one zone than another. So there may be other ways to talk about the writings of Aristarchus, but the analysis focusing on topic 9 is only dealing with one particular pattern which has been identified by the topic modelling software.

Additionally, it can be seen above that main and interior scholia still constitute fairly significant proportions of the scholia within the topic (32.37% and 20.14%, respectively). So to claim that this pattern of language appears only in the intermarginal scholia would be a distortion of the data. Instead, as claimed before, the data only suggests that the topic appears in the intermarginal scholia with a greater frequency than one would expect given the general frequency of the intermarginal scholia across the entire Venetus A.

That claim leads to one larger conclusion, however. By demonstrating that a topic can be distributed amongst the zones of the scholia differently than the general distribution of scholia across the manuscript, one shows that the different zones differ in what sort of topics are featured. So in this case, topic 9, a topic dealing with discussions about Aristarchus, tends to be found more in the intermarginal scholia than in the main or interior scholia. While some topics may not be zone-specific, the fact that some topics like this one do have a preference for a zone points to the fact that the three zones of the scholia cannot be taken as being identical in their content.

Ultimately this points to a difference in source material among the main, interior, and intermarginal scholia. But while the rest of this paper will address issues of source, this research question was able to satisfactorily, though not completely, resolve the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat these three zones of the Venetus A as essentially equivalent. While Dindorf and Allen may have treated the intermarginal and interior as one in the same, the data from topic modelling suggests that this is not the case. There is at least one distinct pattern of language that is found with a disproportionate frequency in the intermarginal scholia. Furthermore, it is unfair of Dindorf to write off the interior and intermarginal zones mere redactions of the main scholia. Again, the topic modelling data suggests that there is a distinct pattern of language inherent to the intermarginal scholia which occurs with a rate disproportionate to the percentage of intermarginal scholia within the Venetus A.

This topic modelling example is just a single example of a difference in content, and many others could and should be made before these conclusions about the difference in purpose among these scholia can be made. But a broader discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper, which was designed to demosntrate how creating a digital text based on a semantic model allows for ready and easy analysis of the text.
