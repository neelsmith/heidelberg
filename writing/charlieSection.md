This paper will now conclude with a abbreviated discussion of two research questions concerning the history of the Iliadic scholia which we were able to pursue through our digital edition of the Venetus A. While a longer discussion is possible, the aim here is to highlight how the implementation of the semantic model in our digital editions makes the following analyses possible. The first analysis concerns the layout of scholia within a typical page of the Venetus A.

Shown above is the fisrt page of the Venetus A manuscript to contain text from the *Iliad*, with the various colored overlays lying on top of the differents zone of scholia on a typical page. For reference, the actual text of the *Iliad* lies in the middle of the page, with the letters written in a darker ink. There are five distinct zones of scholia on a manuscript page: main scholia (shown in yellow), intermarginal scholia (shown in red), interior scholia (shown in blue), exterior scholia (shown in green), and interlinear scholia (not highlighted with a color, but these scholia lie in-between the lines of the *Iliad* text). While not every folio of the Venetus A contains every type of scholia, every folio maintains the spatial integrity of the five zones. So even if there are no exterior scholia on a particular folio, the scribe will not write anything in the space typically occupied by an exterior scholion.  

While the difference in placement on the page for these five distinct zones of Venetus A scholia is patently obvious to any casual onlooker, the difference in function among these zones is much less obvious. This relationship between a scholion's content and its position on the page forms the basis for this first analysis. For example, why would a scribe include a scholion in the main-scholia zone as opposed to the intermarginal zone? Some of this work in trying to disambiguate the function of the five zones was completed by scholars from the nineteenth century. For example, Karl Dindorf, in his 1875 preface to his edition of the Venetus A scholia, argues that the interlinear zone presents no more than glosses on the words which lie below them (ix), and indeed this does seem to be their primary function. As for the exterior scholia, T. W. Allen, in an 1899 article titled "On the Composition of Some Greeks Mansucripts," put forth his hypothesis that these scholia are the result of an editorial pass through the manuscript (181). For Allen, the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia were all written by the same scribe, but the exterior scholia were undoubtedly the work of a different scribe checking the work of the previous scribe against the original sources for the manuscript and making corrections when necessary in the outer margin (172).

The present analysis, however, will mostly focus on the much less clear relationship among the other three zones of scholia: the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia. For his part, Dindorf notes that many of the intermarginal and interior scholia present the same or nearly the same content as the main scholia, and often they use the same exact wording. To him, these shorter intermarginal and interior scholia appeared to be nothing more than redacted versions of the main scholia (Dindorf, vii). From his observations, Dindorf concluded that the intermarginal, interior, and main scholia must have come from similar, though still subtly different sources (vii). However, it is worth noting that when Dindorf uses the phrase *intermarginalia scholia* in his preface, he is actually referring to what the Homer Multitext project would consider the intermarginal and interior zones (Dindorf, vii). While Dindorf's precise description of the *intermarginalia scholia* in his preface is a bit obtuse, Dindorf explains that in his edition he marks all the scholia which he refers to as the *intermarginalia* with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing them with the main scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. Dindorf was not alone in this treatment of these two zones of the scholia as T. W. Allen also uses the single term "intermarginal" to refer to the two distinct zones (181). Thus, for them, there was no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia; they were considered functionally equivalent.

The present analysis therefore sought to explore if the difference between these three zones was more than just where they appeared on the page. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the various zones of scholia might be quantitatively different. Specifically, we relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling, and applied this model to a corpus of 18 books of scholia from the Homer Multitext digital edition of the Venetus A, which includes roughly 8000 scholia. Because of the semantic model the digital editions of the scholia are built upon, it was relatively easy to create a version of the scholia which was optimized for topic modelling using the progamming language scala. In general, running a topic model on an ancient Greek text requires a good deal of preparation. Not only do the scholia need to be lemmatized, but topic modelling requires a corpus in which the most common words are eliminated. Prior to conducting this specific analysis, we had already created various normalized versions of the Venetus A scholia by manipulating the archival text of the Homer Multitext project with scala. In one such version, the HMT's diplomatic transcription of the Venetus A was normalized according to its paleography (a p-normalized version), wherein the words of the scholia were normalized to match the explicit intention of the scribe. So, for example, words which the scribe abbreviated were normalized into their expanded form. A second version of the text took the p-normalized version and normalized it further according to modern orthographic standards (o-normalized version). This is understood easily for words which were missing a breathing mark but were otherwise spelled correctly and had correct accentuation. In this o-normalized edition, all such words were reproduced with the appropriate breathing mark. A third version of the text took the o-normalized version and normalized further, but this time according to morphology in order to create a completely lemmatized version of the text (m-normalized version). This third version made use of the Morpheus parser. Finally, the topic modelling version of the scholia was created by removing the most common words from the the m-normalized version of the text. All of these various versions of the scholia were able to manipulated so easily because the original archival HMT data was built upon that previously discussed explicit semantic model. That abbreviated words can be identified separately from non-abbreviated words, for example, was extremely useful in creating the p-normalized version of the text.

In order to run a topic model, we used ToPan, a topic modelling software developed by Thomas KoÃ«ntges. Because all topic modelling software require users to define the number of topics the program should produce, we had to experiment with the nunmber of topics before any real analysis. Having the software produce too many topics risks not observing any meaningful patterns since extant patterns may be arbitrarily split up into more topics than necessary. On the contrary, producing too few topics can render topics meaningless since words that are supposed to belong to different topics are lumped together. Ultiamtely, we found that 15 topics worked best for our analysis. 

One of the advantages of ToPan is that it produces a clear visualization of the topic modelling results, such as the visualization seen below:

![15-topic model via ToPan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/heidelberg/master/imgs/TranslatedToPan9.jpg)

In this visualization, each of the circles on the left represents a different topic, and when a topic is highlighted, the words which are most strongly associated with the topic are listed on the right. For clarity, I have added Eglish translations of each of the most strongly associated words. Though the results of topic model actually exist in a multidimensional space, the results in this visualization are reduced into a two-dimensional plane using principal compontents analysis. The distance between circles is indicative of how related the topics are. 

As for this particular topic, topic 9, what is most striking among the words which the computer found most strongly associated with one another is the repeated presence of the name Aristarchus, alongside Zenodotus and Aristophanes of Byzantium, all of whom were head of the library of Alexandria at some point in the third and second centuries B.C.E. All three were prominent Homeric scholars producing seminal scholarship which has survived only in pieces through scholiastic references in manuscripts such as the Venetus A. Since a "topic" in a topic model is defined as a repeated pattern of co-occurring words, the appearance of these three names within the same topic indicates that there is a specific pattern of language used when talking about these three scholars, and particularly when discussing Aristarchus. For this reason, we referred to the this topic 9, the ninth topic of this particular topic model, as the "Aristarchus topic."

For the purposes of this analysis, it would be interesting and telling if this pattern of language were to appear with a greater frequency in any of the three zones of interest (main, intermarginal, and interior). While the ToPan visualization is a great tool for analyzing different word patterns, the visualization alone does not give information about what scholia are strongly or weakly associated with each of the topics. However, ToPan does provide robust data tables providing this exact information. In other words, using these tables we were able to analyze how strongly this Aristarchus topic is associated with each scholion since this relationship is scored quantitavtively by the software. This quantitaive measure, the theta-score, exists on a scale of 0 to 1. Were a scholion to have a theta-score of 0.0 with respect to a particular topic, this would indicate that this particular scholion contains no content from that particular topic. Conversely, a theta-score of 1.0 would indicate that the content of this scholion would likely come from this topic alone. 

Ultimately, we were able to move beyond just analyzing individual scholia to analyzing whole zones of scholia. Using these theta-tables we identified the proportion of scholia within each zone (main, intermarginal, and interior) which were strongly associated with this Aristarchus topic. We defined a "strong association" as a scholion having a theta-score equal to or greater than 0.9. Below are the results of this analysis. 


| Zone                            | Total distrib. in Ven. A | Distrib. within Aristarchus Topic |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------|:------------------------|
| Main scholia (yellow)           | 3597 (45.3%)         | 45.0 (32.37%)           |
| **Intermarginal scholia (red)** | **1219 (15.4%)**     | **65.0 (46.76%)**       |
| Interior scholia (blue)         | 819 (10.3%)          | 28.0 (20.14%)           |

The second column presents what percentage of our corpus of eighteen Venetus A books is taken up by each of the zones of scholia. So in other words, the second column is saying that the intermarginal scholia make up about 15% of all the scholia in this subset of the Venetus A. The percentages do not add up to 100% because this table is not displaying the interlinear or exterior scholia since they are not the focus of this analysis. The third column, presents what percentage of the scholia determined to be strongly associated with the Aristarchus topic come from each zone of scholia. So in this example, scholia from the intermarginal zone make up about 47% of scholia which were determined to be strongly associated with the Aristarchus topic.

What is noticeable about the above table is that not only do the intermarginal scholia constitute so much greater a proportion of the strongly-associated scholia than the main scholia, but also that this proportion is over two times that of the intermarginal's proportion within the manuscript. Clearly, the zone distribution for this Aristarchus topic goes against the typical zone distribution seen across the manuscript. Specifically, this Aristarchus topic seems to have a disproportionate concentration within the intermarginal scholia.

This is a point which requires a more thorough explanation in order to fully understand its meaning. The disproportionate concentration of the Aristarchus topic within intermarginal scholia does not mean that the intermarginal scholia are the only scholia where there is any writing about Aristarchus. It should be remembered first of all that a "topic" is defined as words which co-occur frequently. Thus saying that a certain topic appears more in one zone over another only is saying that the particular pattern of co-occurring words identified by the topic model occurs more in one zone than another. So there may be other ways to talk about Aristarchus, but this analysis is by deafult with one particular pattern which has been identified by the topic modelling software.

Additionally, it can be seen above that main and interior scholia still constitute fairly significant proportions of the scholia strongly associated with this topic (32.37% and 20.14%, respectively). So to claim that this pattern of language appears only in the intermarginal scholia would be a distortion of the data. Instead, as claimed before, the data only suggest that the topic appears in the intermarginal scholia with a greater frequency than one would expect given the general frequency of the intermarginal scholia across the entire Venetus A.

That claim does leads to one larger conclusion, however. By demonstrating that a topic can be distributed amongst the zones of the scholia differently than the general distribution of scholia across the manuscript, we demonstrate that the different zones differ in what sort of topics they put forward. So in this case, the Aristarchus topic tends to be found more in the intermarginal scholia than in the main or interior scholia. While some topics may not be zone-specific, the fact that some topics like this one do have a preference for a zone points to the fact that the three zones of the scholia cannot be taken as totally identical in their content. 

Ultimately this inability to see the zones as identical points towards a difference in source material among the main, interior, and intermarginal scholia. While the rest of this paper will directly address issues concerning the source for the scholia, this paper has at this point put forth a satisfactory, though not complete, resolution to the issue of whether it is appropriate to treat these three zones of the Venetus A (main, intermarginal, and interior) as essentially equivalent.  Whereas Dindorf and Allen thought the intermarginal and interior were functionally equivalent, the data from this topic model show that this is not the case. There is at least one distinct pattern of language that is found with a disproportionate frequency in the intermarginal scholia. Furthermore, it is unfair of Dindorf to write off the interior and intermarginal zones mere redactions of the main scholia. Again, the topic modelling data suggests that there is a distinct pattern of language inherent to the intermarginal scholia which occurs disproportionately to the percentage of intermarginal scholia within the Venetus A.

This topic modelling example is just a single example of a difference in content among these zones, and while many others differences have been found in the course of analysis a broader discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper, which was designed to demosntrate how creating a digital text based on a semantic model allows for ready and easy analysis of the text.
