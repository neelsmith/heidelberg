This paper will now conclude with a abbreviated discussion of two research questions concerning the history of the Iliadic scholia which we were able to pursue through our digital edition of the Venetus A. While a longer discussion is possible, the aim here is to highlight how the implementation of the semantic model in our digital editions makes the following analyses possible. The first analysis concerns the layout of scholia within a typical page of the Venetus A.

Shown above is the fisrt page of the Venetus A manuscript to contain text from the *Iliad*, with the various colored overlays lying on top of the differents zone of scholia on a typical page. For reference, the actual text of the *Iliad* lies in the middle of the page, with the letters written in a darker ink. There are five distinct zones of scholia on a manuscript page: main scholia (shown in yellow), intermarginal scholia (shown in red), interior scholia (shown in blue), exterior scholia (shown in green), and interlinear scholia (not highlighted with a color, but these scholia lie in-between the lines of the *Iliad* text). While not every folio of the Venetus A contains every type of scholia, every folio maintains the spatial integrity of the five zones. So even if there are no exterior scholia on a particular folio, the scribe will not write anything in the space typically occupied by an exterior scholion.  

While the difference in placement on the page for these five distinct zones of Venetus A scholia is patently obvious to any casual onlooker, the difference in function among these zones is much less obvious. This relationship between a scholion's content and its position on the page form the foundation of this first analysis. For example, why would a scribe include a scholion in the main-scholia zone as opposed to the intermarginal zone? Some of this work in trying to disambiguate the function of the five zones had already been completed by the end of the nineteenth century. For example, Karl Dindorf, in his 1875 preface to his edition of the Venetus A scholia, argues that the interlinear zone presents no more than glosses on the words which lie below them (ix), and indeed this does seem to be their primary function. As for the exterior scholia, T. W. Allen, in an 1899 article titled "On the Composition of Some Greeks Mansucripts," put forth his hypothesis that these scholia are the result of an editorial pass through the manuscript (181). For Allen, the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia were all written by the same scribe, but the exterior scholia were undoubtedly the work of a different scribe checking the work of the previous scribe against the original sources for the manuscript and making corrections when necessary in the outer margin (172).

This analysis, however, will mostly focus on the much less clear relationship among the other three zones of scholia. For his part, Dindorf notes that many of the intermarginal and interior scholia are the same or nearly the same as main scholia and often use the same exact wording. To him, these shorter intermarginal and interior scholia appeared to be nothing more than redacted versions of the main scholia (Dindorf, vii). From his observations, Dindorf concluded that the intermarginal, interior, and main scholia must have come from similar, though still subtly different sources (vii). However, it is worth noting that when Dindorf uses the phrase *intermarginalia scholia* in his preface, he is actually referring to what the Homer Multitext project would consider the intermarginal and interior zones (Dindorf, vii). While Dindorf's description of the *intermarginalia scholia* is a bit obtuse, our interpretation of his words is strengthened by the fact that Dindorf in his edition marks all the scholia which he refers to as the *intermarginalia* with an asterisk so as to avoid confusing them with the main scholia (Dindorf, ix). When one looks at his edition, however, one notices that scholia which the HMT would call interior are marked with an asterisk alongside those which the HMT would also call intermarginal. T. W. Allen also seems to use the single term "intermarginal" to refer to the two distinct zones (181). Thus it is clear that for these two scholars the separation of scholia into interior and intermarginal scholia did not exist. For them, there was no meaningful difference between what is now called interior and intermarginal scholia.

This analysis therefore sought to elucidate some of the historical confusion concerning these three zones. For this particular inquiry, topic modelling was used extensively in order to highlight in what ways the content of the various zones of scholia was quantitatively different. Specifically, we relied on the Latent Dirichlect Allocation (LDA) model of topic modelling. We were working with a corpus of 18 books of scholia from the Homer Multitext digital edition, which include roughly 8000 scholia. Because of the semantic model the digital editions of the scholia are built upon, it was relatively easy to create a version of the scholia which was optimized for topic modelling using scala. In general, running a topic model on an ancient Greek text requires a good deal of text wrangling. Not only do the scholia need to normalized in order to create a lemmatized version of the text, but topic modelling requires a corpus in which the most common words are eliminated from the corpus. Prior to conducting this research, various normalized versions of the Venetus A scholia had been created with the use of scala scripts. One such version normalized the diplomatic transcription of the Venetus A according to its paleography (a p-normalized version), wherein the words of the scholia were normalized to match the intention of the scribe. So words that were abbreviated were normalized to their expanded form. A second version of the text took the p-normalized version and normalized it further according to modern orthographic standards (o-normalized version). A third version took the o-normalized version and normalized it according to morphology in order to create a completely lemmatized version of the text (m-normalized version). This third version made use of the Morpheus parser. In light of this progression in normalization and since topic modelling requires a text which is heavily prepared, the topic modelling version of the scholia was created by removing the most common words from the the m-normalized version of the text.
