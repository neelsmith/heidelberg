## Recovering the history of Iliadic scholia: architecture and initial results from the Homer Multitext project  (HMT)



---

## Overview

1. Architecture and workflow
2. Application:
    - the construction of the Venetus A MS
    - identifying Aristarchan material


---


## Workflow

- XML source validated against explicit content model
- Pointy brackets stay in the archive
- generate multiple published editions:
    - paleographically normalized
    - orthographically normalized
    - ...
    - TM normalized
- choose edition appropriate to analysis


---

## Explicit semantic model

>Specific model of *contents* complements universal model of citation (OHCO2)
