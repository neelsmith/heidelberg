## Recovering the history of Iliadic scholia: architecture and initial results from the Homer Multitext project  (HMT)



---

## Overview

1. Architecture and workflow
2. Application:
    - the construction of the Venetus A MS
    - identifying Aristarchan material


---


## Workflow

- XML source validated against explicit content model
- Pointy brackets stay in the archive
- generate multiple published editions:
    - paleographically normalized
    - orthographically normalized
    - ...
    - TM normalized
- choose edition appropriate to analysis


---

## Explicit semantic model

>Specific model of *contents* complements universal model of citation (OHCO2)

    - Aristarchus
    - Zenodotus
- Venetus A manuscript (10th c. C.E.)
- Homer Multitext (21st c. C.E.)

## HMT approach to unique layout of scholia

Digitial diplomatic editions in separate XML documents

---

## Why this unique five-zoned layout?

- Interlinear glosses
- Exterior editorial work

##  Why important? Scholia Overlap

*Iliad* Lines|Lines With Scholia|Lines w/ Overlapping Scholia
--- | --- |  ---
~12000|4216 (35%)|1167 (9.7%)

---

## The data set and methodoloy for topic model

- 18 books of scholia (~8000) from Homer Multitext's digital editions
  - includes personal name identifiers
- LDA topic modelling using ToPan software
    - Utilize topic distribution values (Î¸)

## 15-Topic Model, from ToPan

## Extract scholia with high topic distribution values for each topic
